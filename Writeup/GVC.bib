@article{Kummritz2014,
abstract = {Global Value Chains have become a central unit of analysis in research on international trade. However, the complex matrix transformations at the basis of most Value Chain indicators still constitute a significant entry barrier to the field. The R package decompr solves this problem by implementing the algorithms for the analysis of Global Value Chains as R procedures, thereby simplifying the decomposition process. Two methods for gross export flow decomposition using Inter-Country Input-Output tables are provided. The first method concerns a decomposition based on the classical Leontief (1936) insight. It derives the value added origins of an industry's exports by source country and source industry, using easily available gross trade data. The second method is the Wang-Wei-Zhu algorithm, which splits bilateral gross exports into 16 value added components. These components can broadly be divided into domestic and foreign value added in exports. Using the results of the two decompositions, decompr provides a set of Global Value Chain indicators, such as the now standard Vertical Specialisation ratio. This article summarises the methodology of the algorithms, describes the format of the input and output data, and exemplifies the usefulness of the two methods on the basis of a simple example data set.},

abstract = {Global Value Chains (GVCs) have become a central topic in trade and develop-ment policy but little is known about their actual impact on economic performance. Using a new unique set of Inter-Country Input-Output tables with extensive coun-try coverage, I show that an increase in GVC participation leads to higher domestic value added and productivity for all countries independent of their income levels. Causality is established by building a novel value added trade resistance index that combines third country trade costs with industry-specific technological variables leading to an exogenous variation in GVC participation. Based on the preferred IV specification, I find that a 1 percent increase in backward GVC participation leads to 0.11{\%} higher domestic value added in the average industry. Equally, I find for forward linkages that a 1 percent increase in GVC participation leads to 0.60{\%} higher domestic value added and to 0.33{\%} higher labour productivity.},

abstract={This paper documents the construction of BACI, our international trade database, which covers more than 200 countries and 5,000 products, between 1994 and 2007. New approaches have been developed to reconcile data reported by almost 150 countries to the United Nations Statistics Division, collated via COMTRADE. When both exporting and importing countries report to Comtrade, we have two different figures for the same flow, so it is useful to reconcile these into a single figure. To do this, firstly, as import values are reported CIF (cost, insurance and freight) while exports are reported FOB (free on board), transport and insurance rates have to be estimated and removed from import values. We regress the observed CIF/FOB ratios for a given flow on gravity variables and a product-specific world median unit value. In a second step we evaluate the reliability of countries reporting. We decompose the absolute value of the ratios of mirror flows using a (weighted) variance analysis. These measures of the reliability of reported data are used as weights in the reconciliation of each bilateral trade flow which is reported twice. Taking advantage of this bilateral information on each flow, we end up with a large coverage of countries and more reliable data, especially in terms of unit-values. BACI is freely available online to users of COMTRADE database, in different product classifications.},
