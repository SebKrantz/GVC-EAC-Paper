abstract = {Global Value Chains have become a central unit of analysis in research on international trade. However, the complex matrix transformations at the basis of most Value Chain indicators still constitute a significant entry barrier to the field. The R package decompr solves this problem by implementing the algorithms for the analysis of Global Value Chains as R procedures, thereby simplifying the decomposition process. Two methods for gross export flow decomposition using Inter-Country Input-Output tables are provided. The first method concerns a decomposition based on the classical Leontief (1936) insight. It derives the value added origins of an industry's exports by source country and source industry, using easily available gross trade data. The second method is the Wang-Wei-Zhu algorithm, which splits bilateral gross exports into 16 value added components. These components can broadly be divided into domestic and foreign value added in exports. Using the results of the two decompositions, decompr provides a set of Global Value Chain indicators, such as the now standard Vertical Specialisation ratio. This article summarises the methodology of the algorithms, describes the format of the input and output data, and exemplifies the usefulness of the two methods on the basis of a simple example data set.},

%abstract = {Global Value Chains (GVCs) can provide new means for developing economies to industrialise. To fully seize these opportunities, it is neces-sary to comprehensively measure both the intensity and type of countries' GVC integration patterns to better understand the relationship between GVCs and development. In this paper, we apply the new R package de-compr to recent OECD input-output data with extended country cover-age to analyse the integration patterns of developing economies in a more detailed way. We provide evidence that trends in GVCs are increasingly driven by developing countries. In addition, we show that while per capita GDP does not predict the intensity of GVC integration well, it determines the type of integration. High-income countries mainly export intermedi-ates into GVCs and serve as markets of final demand. In contrast, devel-oping economies join GVCs mostly in the assembly stage. However, there is evidence that developing countries have begun to shift their participa-tion from the production of final to intermediate goods, moving upstream in GVCs and out of assembly.},

abstract = {Global Value Chains (GVCs) have become a central topic in trade and develop-ment policy but little is known about their actual impact on economic performance. Using a new unique set of Inter-Country Input-Output tables with extensive coun-try coverage, I show that an increase in GVC participation leads to higher domestic value added and productivity for all countries independent of their income levels. Causality is established by building a novel value added trade resistance index that combines third country trade costs with industry-specific technological variables leading to an exogenous variation in GVC participation. Based on the preferred IV specification, I find that a 1 percent increase in backward GVC participation leads to 0.11{\%} higher domestic value added in the average industry. Equally, I find for forward linkages that a 1 percent increase in GVC participation leads to 0.60{\%} higher domestic value added and to 0.33{\%} higher labour productivity.},

abstract = {This paper generalizes the gross exports accounting framework at the country level, recently proposed by Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2014), to one that decomposes gross trade flows (for both exports and imports) at the sector, bilateral, or bilateral sector level. We overcome major technical challenges for such generalization by allocating bilateral intermediate trade flows into their final destination of absorption. We also point out two major shortcomings associated with the VAX ratio concept often used in the literature and ways to overcome them. We present the dis-aggregated decomposition results for bilateral sector level gross trade flows among 40 trading nations in 35 sectors from 1995 to 2011 based on the WIOD database.},
